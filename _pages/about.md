I an an entrepreneur based in Sydney, Australia travelling frequently to the USA and Asia.

My name is pronounced exactly as you would "Michael".

Growing up the Hills of Adelaide, South Australia, I was extremely fortunate to be given a computer in the early 80s and had access to the internet within the first years of it arriving to our city.

I knew from a very early age that the world was going to be connected and I was going to be part of that.

University couldn't keep me interested and I dropped out with a year to go and started persuing my own goals, 5 years of working in the IT industry, building a highly successful ISP from the ground up, helping form the Victorian Internet Exchange and learning everything I could about everything I could left me unfullfilled.

So I went and become a full time volunteer with the Church of Scientology helping people from around the world solve personal problems and life crippling issues.

After a decade of volunteering, I returned to the work force and started reinteractive and what would eventually become MetaPulse.  I spent the next 10 years growing reinteractive and MetaPulse as well as starting and exiting four other companies.

While building these companies, I also created the [Ruby Mail gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mail) and helped modify the Rails ActionMailer library to use Mail as it's email library, this gained me an invitation to become [Australia's first member of the Ruby on Rails commit team](/archive/2010-09-10-rails-commit-access), of which I am now an Alumni.

I also got married to an incredible lady and have been blessed with the most wonderful daughter.

I now keep myself busy with my family, [my work](/work) and my incredible staff and clients.
