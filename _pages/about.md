I an an entrepreneur based in Sydney, Australia travelling frequently to the USA and Asia.

My name is pronounced exactly as you would "Michael".

Growing up the Hills of Adelaide, South Australia, I was extremely fortunate to be given a computer in the early 80s and had access to the internet within the first years of it arriving to our city.

I knew from a very early age that the world was going to be connected and I was going to be part of that.

University couldn't keep me interested and I dropped out with a year to go and started persuing my own goals, 5 years of working in the IT industry, building a highly successful ISP from the ground up, helping form the Victorian Internet Exchange and learning everything I could about everything I could left me unfullfilled.

So I went and become a full time volunteer with the [Church of Scientology](https://www.scientology.org/) helping people from around the world with [solutions for personal problems and life crippling issues](https://www.volunteerministers.org/).

After a decade of volunteering, I returned to the work force and started [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com) and also [MetaPulse](https://metapulse.com).  I spent the next 10 years growing reinteractive and MetaPulse as well as starting and exiting four other SaaS companies, the largest of which was selling Flood.IO to Tricentis.

In 2017 I started [StoreConnect](https://getstoreconnect.com/) and am growing this to help Small to Medium businesses everywhere scale their online, eCommerce and POS solutions on Salesforce.

While building these companies, I also created the [Ruby Mail gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mail) and helped modify the Rails ActionMailer library to use Mail as it's email library, this gained me an invitation to become [Australia's first member of the Ruby on Rails commit team](/archive/2010-09-10-rails-commit-access), of which I am now an Alumni.

I also got married to an incredible lady and have been blessed with the most wonderful daughter.

I now keep myself busy with my family, [my work](/work) and my incredible staff and clients.
