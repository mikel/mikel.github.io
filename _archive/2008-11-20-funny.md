Some people think that rails is getting bloated... but through the hard
efforts of core committers, the fluff and fat is getting sliced and
trimmed down like a DÃ¶ner kebab spit at a turkish festival...

And here is the perfect example seen on Rails-Contrib on freenode last
night:

```
GitHub142: rails: David Heinemeier Hansson 2-2-stable
SHA1-9d8cc60

[19:07] GitHub142: Reduced the number of literal aliases to the
range that has actually seen personal use. With the massive
savings in overhead, I was able to fit Array#fourty_two
```

Here's the [commit](http://is.gd/8oJA) if you are interested...
