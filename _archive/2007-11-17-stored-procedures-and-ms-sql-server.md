OK, ok, OOOOKAY ALREADY!

I'll say it.....

My name is Mikel, and I'm using Microsoft SQL Server with Rails...

If you are caught in the same situation as me, some of the rails world
is closed to you.

I am working with an existing database and getting Ruby on Rails working
against it. The system is huge, has millions of lines of data and
doesn't use auto incrementing primary keys, pluralised tables or
anything even remotely resembling my MySQL Ruby on Rails
installations....

But I am a person too! I have rights!

The good news is that getting Rails working with SQL Server is actually
not THAT hard... as long as you are running your rails server on the
Microsoft Server.

Also, Rails allows you to pretty much override anything, so this isn't
too hard either.

It's just the hassle of having to think in a new way, really. And MS SQL
Server is a good and powerful server (despite what any MySQL or
Postgress advocates should say).

But what this does give me is the opportunity to start helping knock
down the backlog of MS SQL Server tickets on dev.rubyonrails.org. I can
now help test these and get them committed.

So expect some more posts here about SQL Server and Ruby on Rails
integration... I am sure I will need to refer back a few times!
