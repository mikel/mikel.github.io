Rails 3.0 has a lot of new features. Getting to understand them can be a
challenge. I made a Rails 3.0 repository on github to help everyone get
to know some of the new ActiveModel API...

It is at
[git://github.com/mikel/rails-examples/](http://github.com/mikel/rails-examples/)
and has instructions on how to download it and get it running.

It is actually an entire Rails 3.0 App, ready to run. So you just need
to clone it, follow the four steps given in the README and you will have
Rails 3.0 running on your system.

The models directory contains a bunch of "\_person" models that show off
each main module of the ActiveModel API piece by piece. The
implementations are minimal on purpose to show you what you need to get
the thing working... The instant gratification thing :)

Please check it out and let me know what you think, or improvements we
can make.

One note, you should update the bundler gem if you are on a bundler
version 0.7 or below.
