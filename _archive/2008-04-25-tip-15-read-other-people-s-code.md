It is a great tip, and one I do fairly often, go download some code and
read it until you understand it.

This is a short tip!

#### Sometimes you just need a different perspective.

Getting and installing say, [restful
authentication](http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/plugins/restful_authentication/),
or downloading the [Joyent Connector](http://svn.joyent.com/opensource/)
and reading through some of the code will give you lots of good ideas
about where to go and what to do in your own application development.

A great one for the intermediate Railsite is the [Caboose sample
apps](http://sample.caboo.se/) These really give you a new view on how
to make an app.

Anyway, happy hunting!

Mikel
