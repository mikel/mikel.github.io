I got his when I logged into one of my OpenBSD boxes today.
Interestingly true...

An architect's first work is apt to be spare and clean. He knows he
doesn't know what he's doing, so he does it\
carefully and with great restraint.

As he designs the first work, frill after frill and embellishment after
embellishment occur to him. These get\
stored away to be used "next time". Sooner or later the first system is
finished, and the architect, with firm\
confidence and a demonstrated mastery of that class of systems, is ready
to build a second system.

This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs. When he
does his third and later ones, his prior\
experiences will confirm each other as to the general characteristics of
such systems, and their differences will\
identify those parts of his experience that are particular and not
generalizable.

The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the
ideas and frills that were cautiously\
sidetracked on the first one. The result, as Ovid says, is a "big pile".
