Maintenance release to handle a [remote
hole](http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-6077) in the
framework. You can get the details
[here](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/11/24/ruby-on-rails-1-2-6-security-and-maintenance-release/)

I just installed it on my servers, no problem.

There are two steps involved so be sure to read the blog for
instructions.
