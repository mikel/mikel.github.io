So Rails 2.0 is out! But how do you upgrade? I wrote an article on this
a couple of weeks ago on how to update to Rails RC 2. I just reviewed it
and it still has basically the correct content, so I just updated it to
Rails 2.0. Go have a read if you want, it is called [Updating to Rails
2.0 RC](https://lindsaar.net/2007/11/22/updating-to-rails-2-0-rc)
