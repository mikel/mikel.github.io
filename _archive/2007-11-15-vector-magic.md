Vector magic converts your bitmaps into beautiful phots... for free!

OK.

This rocks.

If you have EVER tried to convert a bitmap into a vector image, you know
how painful this can be with tools like livepaint and other adobe /
corel et al tracing functions.

Well, in comes Stanford University and BOOM, [Vector
Magic.](http://vectormagic.stanford.edu/)

This changes your bitmaps into vectors, the interface is utalitarian,
but it works and it is magical!

What it seems is the Vector Magic takes a look at the whole picture to
work out the best lines, you have to configure some things like is it a
logo or photo etc etc etc.

If you have ever tried to find paths in Photoshop or use live trace in
Illustrator, you will know how much of a pain the resulting vectors are.

But the results of VectorMagic are fantastic!

Go check it out!
