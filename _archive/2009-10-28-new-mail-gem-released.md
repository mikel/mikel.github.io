OK... birthday time. Mail is now a gem!

So, it is hosted on [gemcutter](http://www.gemcutter.org/gems/mail)

It is uploaded to [github](http://github.com/mikel/mail)

Let [me know](http://github.com/mikel/mail/issues) how it runs!

`<strong>`{=html}2009/Dec/26 --- Update:`</strong>`{=html}

In a short two months, we are up to about 1600+ downloads on gemcutter,
version 1.3 of Mail and a bunch of [positive
comments](https://lindsaar.net/2009/11/1/mail-gets-some-compliments)

So dive in with a "gem install mail", you can find the README on how to
do all the basic stuff on GitHub.
