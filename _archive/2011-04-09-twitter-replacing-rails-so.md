Twitter are reportedly moving away from Ruby on Rails. It's on a lot of
people's tweets and on our Rails Oceania Mailing list. But the real
question that should be asked is "So?"

Ruby on Rails is a tool for a job. I run a Ruby and Ruby on Rails
consulting firm and we use Ruby and Rails to do one thing extremely
well, that is rapid, highly customised, web application development. We
can produce applications that fit very complex business models at break
neck speed.

These same applications can then go on, with little or no modification
mind, to serve more requests than ninety nine point lots of nines
websites will *ever* need.

But one thing that Ruby is not suited to is highly concurrent, speed
optimised computing. It's not designed to. Ruby's stated design goal by
Matz (paraphrasing) is programmer happiness and help change the way us
programmers think by providing a language that allows us to express our
ideas and thoughts rapidly, elegantly and simply.

If you want something insanely fast, highly concurrent and optimised to
the gills for speed, use something that is not Ruby, maybe Erlang,
Scala, C, whatever.

If you need a web site developed that is on budget, has a really great
development curve and delivers highly productive and successful web
applications in the shortest possible times, use Rails.

I think the real surprise should not be "OMG, Twitter is moving their
search feature away from Rails!" I think the point is "OMG, Rails has
managed to run *twitter's* search feature successfully for THIS LONG?!"
