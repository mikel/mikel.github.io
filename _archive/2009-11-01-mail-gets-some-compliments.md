As you know, I have put out the new mail gem... here are some of the
things people have said about it:

"Wow, I find this library very exciting! Thanks for sharing." - [James
Edward Gray II](http://blog.grayproductions.net/)

"Nice work. Thanks Mikel." - [Gregory
Brown](http://blog.majesticseacreature.com)

"I just finished parsing the whole Enron set (2.3gb) and the Trec 2005
set (0.5gb) again. The only issues that caused mail parser failures
after the few commits on my fork are all related to bad header values.
Everything else was clear sailing. I didn't verify the correctness of
the parser, just the success/failure, but still that's \~500k emails
that went through fine." - [Jim](http://jimlindley.com/)

"This is gorgeous. If you've got this pile of total awesome waiting for
release, I'd rather jump on it." - [Eric
Hodel](http://blog.segment7.net/)

And only after a few short days, we have 84 people watching mail on
github, compared to the few dozen on TMail.

Thanks for all your comments, keep them and your patches coming!

Mikel
