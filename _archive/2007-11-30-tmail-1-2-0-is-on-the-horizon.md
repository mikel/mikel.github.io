We are about to release TMail 1.2.0...

There are a bunch of patches in TMail 1.2.0 fixing several problems with
attachments and other simple mail handling stuff.

Additionally, there is now about 500 lines of documentation going into
TMail 1.2.0, all written by your truly, hope you like it.

One of the areas where Ruby tools in general fail is in documentation,
writing it is quite a chore though, believe me! Especially when you are
picking up the pieces of someone else's code and figuring out what the
hell goes where. It is quite a job!

But document we must.

Anyway, I'll keep you posted.

Mikel
