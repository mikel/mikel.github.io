If you visit my website, you can see the badge, and it is true, this
Aussie munchkin is making the trek to the US of A to talk to a bunch of
people about a little section of Rails.

The talk is called "Itch Scratching the ActionMailer API" and I am going
to discuss how it all happened, from starting with TMail, why I got fed
up with it, why I started Mail, how I went about coding it including
spec examples and my workflow, and then onto integrating Mail into
ActionMailer and then onto rewriting the ActionMailer API.

I hope it will be an interesting talk, I'll also be going over Mail and
how to use it and some of the lesser known features that you can take
advantage of in Rails.

Hope to see you there! If you have any suggestions or things you would
like me to include, hit me up in the comments, or via Twitter or through
my email address.

See you soon!
