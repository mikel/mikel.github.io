If you are like me and are on a mac in a Windows Network, you will be
happy to hear that our uphill battle on connecting to AD servers is now
a thing of the past.

Go and download 10.5.3 and install (or just use your software update)

After install, I could copy and move files on the server with ease, and
no zero-byte file problems that were happening before.

Woohoo!
