Rails has just had a rather nasty security alert, get your application
upgraded now. If you know what you are doing, you can follow the
instructions inside of the [Security Alert
notes](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ),
if you don't, then you can get an [fixed price upgrade
service](http://reinteractive.net/service/secure) from reInteractive.
But whatever you do, do it soon.
