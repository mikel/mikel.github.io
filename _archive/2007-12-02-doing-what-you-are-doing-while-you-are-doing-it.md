Being constantly connected to the Internet is a double edged sword. The
volume of distractions are just massive and keeping your focus can be
difficult. At least that is how it is for me. This is how I solve it...

I use a simple phrase "Doing what you are doing while you are doing it".

It actually, could be stated as another definition for Happiness. But I
digress.

I was reading [Matt
Allen's](http://blog.allen.com.au/2007/10/17/going-dark) blog about
"Going Dark" and it spurred me into an idea.

As a programmer and developer, I am constantly being torn between
priorities and tasks. They never seem to end, it is almost like we, as
programmers or developers (I'll just use developers from now on if
that's cool with you) sit down and invent a constant stream of problems
to keep us occupied and make us happy.

A reverse proof of this would be, have you ever seen a non-busy
successful developer? Nope? Neither have I.

But I have spoken with a lot of developers and people who are REALLY
busy, and the happy ones have one broad thing in common. They do what
they are doing, while they are doing it.

In writing this I took a look at my own work day and, being a developer,
I looked back over the past few weeks at the days where I felt I
actually achieved something worthwhile and useful.

Getting a new website online (finally), that was a good day. Getting a
major update done to an internal system and completing it, that was a
good day. Get the blog online properly, that was a good day. etc...

What did all these days have in common? I focused on one project,
basically ignored everything else to the best of my human ability and
got THAT ONE THING DONE.

I was doing what I was doing, while I was doing it.

I wasn't trying to bend ActiveRecord's SQLServer connection to my will
while I had this constant stream of "To do lists" or "people asking for
help" or "crap, I have to get that done before tomorrow" or even [I'd
rather be sailing](http://www.wowwiki.com/Quotes_of_Warcraft_II)

There are a few parts to this though. What is it you really need to do
to create an environment where you CAN do what you are doing while you
are doing it?

I think you can break it down into broad areas:

1.  Working out a plan for the day's production
2.  Providing a distraction free space
3.  Encouraging your environment to assist you.

#### Working out a plan for the day's production

This is fairly easy, but it takes a bit of discipline. At the start of
each day's production (or at the end of the night, the previous day),
write out a list of things you need to do based on priority. This way,
when you start, you have something to remind you to keep your attention
focused and get through tasks 1-4 because you HAVE to get step 5 done
today. This also helps you focus a lot. I tend to do this in plain paper
in a diary by day as I find I can scribble draw etc and the actual act
of hand writing it out helps me focus.

The other point here is that you actually need to allocate time for
various things. Like, if you do write a blog daily, set aside the 20-30
minutes a day to actually do this and then do THAT while you are doing
it.

#### Providing a distraction free space

This is a bit more tricky, depending on where you are, but here are some
pointers:

1.  Turn off (if you can) visual clues on your system that you have a
    new e-mail, or someone just entered the chat room of IRC. If you
    MUST get a notification of new email from certain people, set up a
    filter for it so that IT lands in your inbox and everything else
    goes into a "Secondary-Inbox" Then, when you get that important
    message you get an alert, and the rest can wait.
2.  If your desk is in a high traffic area, see if you can move it to a
    lower traffic area. I did this and my production went up about 30%
    because I got 30% less office "buddies" talking to me.
3.  If you can't handle the background noise, put on a set of headphones
    that block out noise and play some music. It really helps with me,
    it might with you.

#### Encouraging your environment to assist you.

Here is where you get to practice all those interpersonal relation
skills you have gained from sitting behind a computer screen all day :)

1.  If people come to ask you something and distract you, politely ask
    them to (next time they want something if it is not critical and
    urgent) just write you a note, email or whatever and let you answer
    it when you can.
2.  Get some agreement with your boss to let you keep going on what you
    are doing and let you finish it. You can explain to him the details
    of loading and unloading all the code from your mind space and the
    work it takes to get into the zone of programming.
3.  Encourage the idea "Don't disturb Mikel if he has his headphones on"
    or whatever else you can do to get this nailed in.
4.  Set your IM's to "busy" and shut down or apply the email handlings I
    suggested in number 1 above.

#### Summary

Getting things done is actually a lot of fun, really, it is why you and
I are doing what we are doing, while we are doing it! Hope this helps
you too.

But I can not claim that this phrase of "Do what you are doing, while
you are doing it" is mine, because it isn't, it comes from [L. Ron
Hubbard's](http://www.lronhubbard.org.au/) [management
technology](http://www.wiseanzo.org/) from the policy letter on Doing
Work.
