THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #10: SIMPLE

SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming
Language`<br />`{=html}\
Environment. This language, developed at the Hanover College
for`<br />`{=html}\
Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write
code`<br />`{=html}\
with errors in it. The statements are, therefore, confined to
BEGIN,`<br />`{=html}\
END and STOP. No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't
make`<br />`{=html}\
a syntax error. Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.
Thus`<br />`{=html}\
they achieve the results of programs written in other languages
without`<br />`{=html}\
the tedious, frustrating process of testing and
debugging.`<br />`{=html}
