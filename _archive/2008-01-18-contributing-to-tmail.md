I recently added a new page to the TMail site, contributing!

It's easy to do, go to "http://tmail.rubyforge.org/contributing/":
http://tmail.rubyforge.org/contributing/ and follow the dots. Soon you
will be disco dancing with the best.

If you haven't read my [Are you a real
programmer?](https://lindsaar.net/2007/12/5/are-you-a-real-programmer)
post, then maybe you should...

Seriously though, this is an important leap for anyone who is into open
source software, get on the band wagon and contribute.

Besides, I have always believed that your only true measure of worth is
how much you can assist and help others. That comes from my
[Scientology](http://www.scientology.org.au/) belief anyway.

So go forth, contribute, and enjoy!
