Even though they got my name wrong :) Gregg Poolak and Jason Seinfield
have a fantastic podcast that you all should subscribe to.

If you haven't already, head on over to
`<a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/" target="_blank">`{=html}Rails
Envy`</a>`{=html} and sign up for the podcast.

Greg's and Jason's podcast has an appropriate mix of humour, programer
ethics, enterprise structure and development with a dash of gannt charts
to really get you into the swing of long term, MMMDD (methodically
mistaken meeting driven development). Just thinking about subscribing to
such a podcast gets my memo pen itching to write out another proposal...

Actually, in reality their podcast goes over the week that was in the
Ruby on Rails field, and is really worth a listen each week. It brings
you up to speed on new developments, what the latest in Rails
development is and good plugins, tools etc that have been released.

Check them out.

And Gregg and Jason, when you get the upteen **million** subscribers
that will **obviously** sign up from the **flood** of hits and referrals
you get from this blog entry, send me some of that sponsorship love :)
