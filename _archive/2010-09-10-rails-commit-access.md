Hi all, I'm really happy to announce that I am the first Australian to
have been invited into the commit team for Ruby on Rails!

About 48 hours ago, I was pleasantly surprised to read in the Rails Core
campfire chat that David, Jeremy and Yehuda all decided that I should be
put into the Rails commit team.

While this does not mean I am part of the "Core Team" yet, it does mean
I can help move Rails forward at a rapid rate, and also means Australia
now has a local who has commit access to the [Rails Organisation
repositories](http://github.com/rails)

Mostly, this was due to my work with the [Action Mailer
3](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/mikel-lindsaar/commits)
updates with Mail, but I plan to extend this to other areas like Active
Resource.

I am honoured to be given this access and hope to carry the torch for
all Rubyists, especially those in Australia, for a long time!

So you will be seeing me a lot more in the commit logs from me and I'll
definitely be helping out on Rails in between my consulting work as the
founder of [reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/)
