I was asked by the guys at EngineYard (who have created RailsDispatch)
to host this week's topic,
[ActionMailer](http://www.railsdispatch.com/posts/actionmailer/).

Of course I agreed, and the result is [now
online](http://www.railsdispatch.com/posts/actionmailer/). There is a
shortish (10 minute) screen cast as well as a very detailed article.

The article really goes into depth on ActionMailer, I tried to cover all
the major points and walk through all the parts that I felt were
important. The screen cast shows you just how easy it is to setup email
now.

Please feel free to let me know what you think in the comments here!
