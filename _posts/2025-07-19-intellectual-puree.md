I’ve started writing again.

This is the first. The goal is to write one considered piece each week and publish it here.

The topics will vary, the style may change, but the purpose won’t.

Purpose?

Such a powerful word. But in this case, maybe not so.

I don’t want to lose my ability to critically think, form words and communicate them.

In this modern world of AI we are moving away from having to think. “Explain it like I’m 5” is spoon feeding our minds with intellectual purée. A carefully blended mix of concepts warmed to the perfect temperature to not burn on the way down.

Unfortunately it also usually ends up all over the bowl, table, bib and floor as we don’t go deep enough to find a true understanding and instead skim the surface enjoying our mental endorphins.

I’m loving the utility of AI, I use it almost every day, and I know it will (has?) already changed the world.

But humans do. We learn through action. We hone our skills through hard fought repetition.

And as much as I live the Matrix movies, we can’t call Tank to download how to fly a helicopter.

So I am writing. I’ll explore some ideas I have, I’ll share some thoughts and see where this takes me. It might be fun, but it will be educational, especially for me.

Because I like steak.
